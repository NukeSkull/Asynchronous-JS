# Asynchronous-JS by NukeSkull

Small project I created that retrieves dogs images from an API in order to learn about Async/Await and Promises in Javascript

## Set Up
- Run on terminal `npm install`

## Run
- Run on terminal `npm start`
- A new file should appear with the URL of the retrieved images
